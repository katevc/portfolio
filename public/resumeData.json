    "bio":"Hi! I'm Kate. When I started studying business at UofM, I quickly became more and more interested in the power of tech. So, after taking an introductory coding class, I decided to apply this newfound passion to a second major in Computer Science. In my coursework and professional experience, I have learned C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Python. I've also written projects in Javascript, ReactJS, and VueJS. In addition to these technical skills, I love to work as part of a team and practice my ability to listen and communicate clearly and effectively with others. Some of the topics I've studied in my UofM coursework include Data Structures and Algorithms, Human-Computer Interaction, User Interface Development, Management in Organizations, Corporate Strategy, and More!",
